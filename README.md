# Battlecados

The goal for this game was originially for it to be a mobile game but because of our lack of game development experience we ended up building a PC and Mac game in Unity.
This however also posed a problem for us and a few aspects of the game do not work properly outside of the unity editor so we ask that whoever is grading this assignment to open the project through Unity and play it through the Game View window in the Unity editor.

The very first scene to start from is the User.unity scene located directly in the assets folder.

## Getting Started

### Controls

The game's controls are point and click with a mouse

### The Actual Game

1. The first scene you will see is a start screen, click to continue
2. Next, you will need to navigate to the "Create Account" screen to make an account. It is important to not here that an internet connection is nessecary to play the game.
3. Now that you've created an account you need to suit up your Avocado! Navigate to the Manage Cards screen and then to Open Packs in order to open the free card packs you get with creating your account.
4. Click on the packs that you would like open and once you are done opening all of your packs navigate pack to the Manage Cards screen. There are 4 types of cards you will see, weapon cards (Red), chest and head armor cards (grey), support cards (green) and salvage cards (yellow).
5. Click on the empty card slots around your Avocado to equip some of the cards that you have gotten from your packs. You will see your avocados stats changing with the cards that you equip.
6. Now you're ready to battle! Navigate back to the Main Menu and select "Story". We initially wanted to add an online component to the game and that is what the "Versus" button takes you to. However, that was a bit ambitious of us and we did not have time to implement it. That screen right now is just a perpetual loading screen that you can leave when you feel you've waited long enough.
7. Once in battle you have two battle options, attack or use a support card. Attacking ends your turn and does damage to your opponent. Using a support card ends your turn and increase your stats.
8. Once one of the players health is 0, the battle will be over. After the battle you gain gold and experience points. The gold can be used to buy card pack from the Buy Packs menu and the experienc points can level up your Avocado when you have enough and your Avocado's stats will increase with your level when that happens.
