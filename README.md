# Battlecados

The goal for this game was originially for it to be a mobile game but because of our lack of game development experience we ended up building a PC and Mac game in Unity.
This however also posed a problem for us and a few aspects of the game do not work properly outside of the unity editor so we ask that whoever is grading this assignment to open the project through Unity and play it through the Game View window in the Unity editor.
The very first scene to start from is the User.unity scene located directly in the assets folder.
